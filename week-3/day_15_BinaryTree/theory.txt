1. Understand the Basics
Difference between Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures

Linear Data Structures:
Elements are arranged sequentially, one after another.
Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
Traversal: Simple and straightforward (one-dimensional).

Non-Linear Data Structures:
Elements are arranged hierarchically or connected through relationships.
Examples: Trees, Graphs, Heaps.
Traversal: Requires algorithms (like DFS, BFS) due to complex structures.

Why Use Non-Linear Data Structures?
Trees:
Efficient for hierarchical data (e.g., file systems, DOM in web).

Graphs:
Useful for relationships and connectivity (e.g., social networks, maps).

Heaps:
Ideal for priority-based operations (e.g., job scheduling, finding the smallest/largest element).
